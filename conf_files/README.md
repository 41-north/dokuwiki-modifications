# .conf files

This directory contains modified conf files for DokuWiki. Whenever possible, files should be named as .local.conf as (theoretically), that will prevent the file from being overwritten on DokuWiki upgrades.

Please see [https://wiki.41n.co/wiki/dokuwiki-modifications#conf_files](https://wiki.41n.co/wiki/dokuwiki-modifications#conf_files) for more information.
