# Icons

Customized icons used in the 41N DokuWiki instance. Some of these icons are utilized in 'interwiki' links, while others are replacing DokuWiki-installed icons. 

Theoretically, the 'interwiki' icons should survive a DW upgrade. ~~However, the custom icons will be wiped out by the upgrade and will need to be installed.~~ Custom icons (external-link) are now being modified in the theme's CSS.
